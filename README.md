# This Might Be A DOMb Idea

Your task (whether you choose to accept it or not?) is to manipulate the DOM in the following ways:

* Change the font color of the paragraph to light blue.
* Change the font size of the heading to 10 pixels.
* Change the text of the paragraph to be the following Hipster Ipsum:

> Lorem ipsum dolor amet viral meh selfies drinking vinegar, intelligentsia poke flannel twee paleo enamel pin cray. Banjo celiac crucifix, kickstarter la croix air plant jianbing hashtag vinyl hell of man bun selvage schlitz banh mi. Tacos hella raclette quinoa blog, williamsburg adaptogen tbh. Hexagon af stumptown lumbersexual synth gentrify quinoa enamel pin celiac master cleanse. Truffaut typewriter shoreditch, semiotics iceland mixtape taxidermy umami distillery austin hashtag. Food truck synth wayfarers, street art banh mi actually authentic. Bitters tousled tattooed vegan neutra pug hell of fixie chia unicorn letterpress.

* Change the 13th item to be half transparent.
* Change the 3rd item's text to say:
> I say, "Hi!"
* Change the image below the list to be [this image](http://www.tioxic.com/wp-content/uploads/trex_4.jpg).
* Change that image's size to be 300 pixels high.
* Add a new image below that to an image of your choice, and make it 300 pixels high.
* Add a 16th `<li>` to the list, with the same class as the others, and with an id that follows the others' numbering scheme.
* Give that `<li>` the following text:
> I won't be fooled again.
